# Neural Network Potential Workshop
Workshop material for "Practical Introduction to Neural Network Potentials"

3:00 - 4:00 PM; Wednesdays July 20 - August 17  
Molecular Science and Engineering (MoSE) Room 4202A

This workshop is a 5-week crash course on machine learning methods for modeling potential energy surfaces (PESâ€™s) of small molecules. Each session is a lecture followed by a hands-on guided exercise via GitHub. The workshop starts with a broad overview of machine learning methodologies. By the end of the workshop, attendees will have implemented a state-of-the-art graph neural network model.

### Getting Started

Each directory contains a separate presentation and related Python exercise. To participate in the exercises, we recommend working in a conda environment on a personal computer. A non-exhaustive list of Python packages needed for the exercises:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- pytorch
