This workshop is a 5-week crash course on machine learning methods for modeling potential energy surfaces (PESâ€™s) of small molecules. Each session is a lecture followed by a hands-on guided exercise via GitHub. The workshop starts with a broad overview of machine learning methodologies. By the end of the workshop, attendees will have implemented a state-of-the-art graph neural network model.
